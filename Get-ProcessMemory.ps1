function ReadProcessMemory
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
 
    Reads data from an area of memory in a specified process. The entire area to be read must be accessible or the operation fails.
 
    .DESCRIPTION
 
    ReadProcessMemory copies the data in the specified address range from the address space of the specified process into the specified buffer of the current process. Any process that has a handle with PROCESS_VM_READ access can call the function.
 
    The entire area to be read must be accessible, and if it is not accessible, the function fails.
 
    .PARAMETER ProcessHandle
 
    A handle to the process with memory that is being read. The handle must have PROCESS_VM_READ access to the process.
 
    .PARAMETER BaseAddress
 
    The base address in the specified process from which to read. Before any data transfer occurs, the system verifies that all data in the base address and memory of the specified size is accessible for read access, and if it is not accessible the function fails.
 
    .PARAMETER Size
 
    The number of bytes to be read from the specified process.
